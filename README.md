IMAGE-CLASSIFICATION-MODEL

***Image Classification with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)***
Overview

This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for image classification using the CIFAR-10 dataset. The model is built using TensorFlow and Keras, and it aims to classify images into one of ten categories: airplane, automobile, bird, cat, deer, dog, frog, horse, ship, and truck.

*Requirements*
To run this project, you need to have the following libraries installed:
. TensorFlow
. NumPy
. Matplotlib
You can install the required libraries using pip:
- pip install tensorflow numpy matplotlib
  
...

*Dataset*
The CIFAR-10 dataset consists of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 different classes, with 6,000 images per class. The dataset is divided into 50,000 training images and 10,000 test images. The dataset can be easily loaded using TensorFlow's Keras API.

...

*Model Architecture*
The CNN model consists of the following layers:

Convolutional Layer: 32 filters with a 3x3 kernel and ReLU activation.
MaxPooling Layer: Reduces the spatial dimensions by half.
Convolutional Layer: 64 filters with a 3x3 kernel and ReLU activation.
MaxPooling Layer: Further reduces the spatial dimensions.
Convolutional Layer: 64 filters with a 3x3 kernel and ReLU activation.
Flatten Layer: Converts the 3D feature maps into a 1D vector.
Dense Layer: 64 units with ReLU activation.
Output Layer: 10 units (one for each class) without activation.

...

*Training the Model*
The model is compiled with the following parameters:

  Optimizer: Adam
  Loss Function: SparseCategoricalCrossentropy (suitable for integer labels)
  Metrics: Accuracy
  
The model is trained for 10 epochs using the training dataset, with validation on the test dataset.

- history = model.fit(train_images, train_labels, epochs=10, validation_data=(test_images, test_labels))

...
  
*Evaluating the Model*
After training, the model is evaluated on the test dataset to obtain the final performance metrics, including accuracy and loss.

- test_loss, test_acc = model.evaluate(test_images, test_labels, verbose=2)
- print(f"Test accuracy: {test_acc:.4f}")

...

*Making Predictions*
The trained model can be used to make predictions on new images. The output probabilities can be obtained by adding a Softmax layer to the model.

- predictions = probability_model.predict(test_images)

...

*Visualizations*
You can visualize the training and validation accuracy and loss over epochs to assess the model's performance. Uncomment the relevant sections in the code to generate these plots.
